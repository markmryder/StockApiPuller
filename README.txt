In order to use this program, you will need an API key from RapidAPI.com for Yahoo Finance.
Place the key inside the apiKey.txt file.

Then add any stock tickers symbols you would like to track into quotes.txt, one per line. You should be able to
run the program now. The output will be quotes.csv, which will have the ticker symbols and their respective last
closing price.

There will also be last trading day's CAD/USD conversion on the final line.
